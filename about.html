                    <p class="my-4">My name is Bridgette, and I’m an illustrator and graphic/web designer based in the heart of Central Valley, California. I have had a passion for art and creativity since I was very young which ultimately led me to pursue a career focused on creativity. During my pursuit of creative career options, I discovered a passion for technology and web design, and it opened up a world of new possibilities. I began working towards my A.S. in web design in 2018, then in 2020 I transferred and began working towards my B.A. in graphic design with a web design concentration.</p>
                    <p>When I’m not working on a graphic design project, I’m a busy mom of three, usually managing the household and spending time with my family. The love and support from my husband and my three kids is what keeps me going day to day and I definitely couldn’t do it without them! My other hobbies include photography, sketching, painting, woodwork, playing video games, listening to music, and making the occasional hyper focused attempt to learn to play guitar. <i class="fa fa-grin-wink" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
                    <p>I am currently still in the process of finishing my degree and anticipate graduation in 2022. My journey has not been easy but so far, it’s been super exciting, and I have had a lot of fun! I have learned a lot along the way and expect that I will continue to learn and grow in this career. I absolutely love what I do and I am looking forward to where this journey will take me next!</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in my work, please feel free to reach out and I will get a response to you as soon as I can.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
